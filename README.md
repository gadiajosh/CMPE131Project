## Project's Central Idea / Abstract.
There are multiple marketplaces already available to the general public. 
Since it is a general market place there are so many things being put up to sale,
ranging from video games to home furniture. The market for engineering items are not as high as these items, 
so it is easier for them to overlooked and lost within the marketplace. 
Because of this, we wanted to create a simple marketplace designed for SJSU engineering students to buy and sell items in relation to their major. The website will provide the contact information of the buyer rather than giving the seller the ability to buy the item online. 

UPDATE
Rather than a website, we decided to create an iOS application instead. This meant programming the application using swift. We chose to do an application because since we were more comfortable programming in C, we felt Swift was the best way to go. We are running the application through XCODE and it is fairly simple to navigate. Aside from XCODE there is no other program/special instructions needed for the application to run.
